They are looking to reduce their cost of scanning and preparing documents for Dodge.  However, they have a comfortable relationship with Xerox that will be hard to change because they have established good procedures, and they work.\n\nWhen they asked Rick about how ReproMAX scans, they were told that everyone has different standards and equipment and it was everywhere from 200-600 DPI.  This kind of spooked them about our ability to do quality work.  They are very concerned about consistency.\n\nThey like the model of free scanning with guarantee of X number of free sets…\n\nNorbert (President) is having a "All Hands On Deck" meeting on the 15th and wants a one-page summary of what they should do…\n\n10/28/2004\n\nBob has had a number of jobs recently.  He has worked for Tim Ryan recently and really wants to make this project go.
