| **Action Panel**                       | The collapsible panel between the Entity Bar and the Content Panel (~280px default) that provides view switching, view configuration, and folder navigation. Also called the "view control center."                                                                                                                                                                                                                | GUI Functional Requirements               |
| **Activity Card**                      | A Card Type that displays a chronological stream of past interactions related to the entity. Filterable by channel, date range, and entity type. Represents *what happened* — contrast with Calendar Card which shows *what's scheduled*.                                                                                                                                                                          | GUI Functional Requirements               |
| **Administration Entity**              | A non-data Entity Selector on the Entity Bar: Home (top section), Settings, and Account (bottom section). Treated as Entity Selectors for navigation purposes, though their display behavior on click varies from data entity types. Help is not an Administration Entity — it lives on the Application Tool Bar.                                                                                                  | GUI Functional Requirements               |
| **Aggregate Conversation**             | A Conversation with `is_aggregate = true`. Serves as an organizational container that groups related child Conversations and can hold its own direct Communications. Replaces the former Topic entity. Nesting is unlimited with acyclic enforcement.                                                                                                                                                              | Conversations                             |
| **AI Status**                          | Semantic Conversation state derived from AI analysis of communication content: `open`, `closed`, or `uncertain`. Distinct from System Status, which is time-based.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Conversations                             |
| **AI-Extracted Task**                  | A Task auto-created by the AI action-item extraction behavior from conversation intelligence. Has `source = 'ai_extracted'`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Tasks                                     |
| **Application Shell**                  | The outermost UI framework: Application Tool Bar (top), Entity Bar, Action Panel, Content Panel, Detail Panel, and Application Status Bar (bottom). All entity-specific interfaces render within this shell.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | GUI Functional Requirements               |
| **Application Status Bar**             | A fixed, full-width bar along the bottom of the application window. Displays contextual status information such as sync status, background job progress, current view record counts, selection context, and non-intrusive error/warning notifications. Application-wide scope. Detailed content specification deferred to a future phase.                                                                          | GUI Functional Requirements               |
| **Application Tool Bar**               | The fixed, full-width bar at the top of the application. Contains location breadcrumb (left), global search (center), and Help (right). Application-wide scope. Spans above all four zones. Replaces the former term "Top Header Bar."                                                                                                                                                                             | GUI Functional Requirements               |
| **Approval Queue**                     | The list of automation-generated outbound emails awaiting user review and approval before sending.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Outbound Email                            |
| **Assignee**                           | A user with the `assignee` role on a Task, responsible for completing the work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Tasks                                     |
| **Attendee Resolution**                | The process of matching an event attendee's email address to an existing Contact record via `contact_identifiers`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Events                                    |
| **Attribute Card**                     | A Card Type that displays field name/value pairs from the entity's Field Registry, organized by Field Groups. Shows formatted values in View Mode and supports Section-Based Editing in Edit Mode. Example: "Name: John Smith, Title: VP Sales, Phone: 555-1234."                                                                                                                                                  | GUI Functional Requirements               |
| **Auto-Configuration Event**           | A trigger that causes the layout engine to run: view open, significant resize (>15% change in either dimension), or explicit user reset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Adaptive Grid Intelligence                |
| **Auto-Organization**                  | AI-driven classification and routing of Communications into Conversations and suggestion of Aggregate Conversation placement, with user review and correction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Conversations                             |
| **Behavior**                           | A registered piece of specialized logic on a system object type (e.g., identity resolution on Contact, AI status detection on Conversation). Custom object types do not have behaviors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Custom Objects                            |

| **Bounce**                             | A delivery failure where the recipient's mail server rejects an outbound email. Hard bounces indicate permanent failure (invalid address); soft bounces indicate temporary issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Outbound Email                            |
| **Cardinality**                        | The multiplicity of a Relation Type: one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Custom Objects                            |
| **Calendar Card**                      | A Card Type that displays forward-looking scheduled events related to the entity. Shows upcoming meetings, deadlines, and appointments. Rendered as a compact agenda list or mini-calendar view. Represents *what's scheduled* — contrast with Activity Card which shows *what happened*.                                                                                                                          | GUI Functional Requirements               |
| **Card Layout Area**                   | The region of a Window below the Identity Card where the entity's configured Cards are arranged. In the Docked Window, Cards stack vertically in a single column. In wider Window Types (Modal Full Overlay Window, Undocked Window), Cards can be arranged in multi-column layouts optimized for available space. Replaces the former separate "Context Zone" and "Activity Timeline Zone."                       | GUI Functional Requirements               |
| **Card Type**                          | A category of self-contained content container used to display grouped information within a Window. Each Card Type defines a distinct data presentation pattern. Ten types: Identity Card, Attribute Card, Relation Card, Content Card, Activity Card, Calendar Card, Timeline Card, List Card, Metric Card, Summary Card. Card Types are the building blocks users can configure for each entity's Window layout. | GUI Functional Requirements               |

Each status maps to exactly one Status Category.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Tasks                                     |
| **Status Category (Task)**             | One of four system categories (`not_started`, `active`, `done`, `cancelled`) that drive system behavior for Tasks. Immutable — users cannot create new categories.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Tasks                                     |

| **Visibility**                         | A concrete attribute on every record: `private`, `shared`, or `public`. Determines who can discover and view the record. Not inferred from ownership or roles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Permissions & Sharing                     |
| **Visibility Cascade**                 | The mechanism by which a shared Folder makes its contained Documents accessible to users who can see the folder, regardless of individual Document visibility settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Documents                                 |
| **Visual Query Builder**               | A UI-based tool for constructing Data Source queries by selecting entities, joins, columns, and filters without writing SQL. Generates a structured query configuration that the query engine executes.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Data Sources                              |
| **Watcher (Task)**                     | A user with the `watcher` role on a Task, observing progress without responsibility for completing or reviewing the work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Tasks                                     |
| **Window Type**                        | The category of UI container in which entity data renders. Window Types compose with Display Modes to describe any entity display context. Types: Docked Window, Modal Full Overlay Window, Modal Partial Overlay Window, Floating Modal, Floating Unmodal, Undocked Window, Search Window.                                                                                                                        | GUI Functional Requirements               |
