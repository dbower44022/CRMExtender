Hi Doug! And thank you so much for advising me. I have what the developers
call a "Wireframe" and it is very wordy and lengthy (at least 150 pages). I
haven't completely read it all and I wished there were more graphics. I
have it saved to a jump drive at home and I can send it to you tonight when
I get back. But it does detail what the website is supposed to do. Is that
what you were referring to?
