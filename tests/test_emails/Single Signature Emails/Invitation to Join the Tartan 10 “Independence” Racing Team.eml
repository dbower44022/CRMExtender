Dear Friends and Fellow Sailors,

I hope this finds you well as we head into the new year=E2=80=94I=E2=80=99m=
 already excited
about what could be an outstanding 2026 sailing season on the Great Lakes!

I=E2=80=99m reaching out because each recipient on this email has expressed
interest in racing with me on my Tartan 10 *Independence*.

As a lifelong Tartan 10 sailor and class participant, I know firsthand how
rewarding this one-design fleet can be. The Tartan Ten (T-10) is a
comfortable, balanced, highly maneuverable 33-foot (10 meter) racer with
relatively heavy construction and ballasting.  The comfortable, open layout
and maneuverability is perfect for close quarters buoy racing: controlled
rules on modifications and sails keep the focus on skill and teamwork, not
equipment budgets. The T-10 was the first successful =E2=80=9Coffshore one =
design=E2=80=9D
racing boat on the Lakes. Although the boats went out of production 40
years ago we still see strong turnouts (25-30+ boats at Nationals) and
tight, fun competition.

For more on the class, check out the official T-10 Class Association
website: https://ttenclass.com/

A bit about my particular T-10, *Independence*: The boat is hull 352, one
of the last made (in 1984).  The boat is fast, with several upgrades
completed and one more scheduled this winter.

If we lock in a committed team, I=E2=80=99ll invest in new sails to maximiz=
e our
speed potential.

To get a real feel for the boat, the sailing action, and what our racing
looks like, check out my YouTube channel Independence Video:
https://youtube.com/@independencevideo9836.

Many of these videos were taken with a 360-degree camera mounted on the
stern pulpit=E2=80=94YouTube lets you interactively move the view around to=
 focus
on points of interest (like crew work, trim, or the competition), or watch
with a VR/3D headset for a true immersive experience vitually on the water.

A philosophical point - I find the greatest value in racing when it remains
a true Corinthian sport=E2=80=94participation driven by the love of sailing=
, skill
development, and camaraderie, rather than thinking of sailing as a
financial competition, ego-trip, or a professional exploit. For that
reason, I=E2=80=99ve never hired professional crew and intend to keep it th=
at way.
I have no objection to the presence of the professionally crewed boats=E2=
=80=94they
set an inspiring high standard and push everyone to improve=E2=80=94but my =
goal is
to put forth a strong amateur effort with a dedicated group of friends and
passionate sailors.

To get the most out of the season=E2=80=94and to race safely and competitiv=
ely,
particularly in the windier conditions that bring out the best of a T-10
and which I love the most (15+ MPH winds)=E2=80=94the best way to campaign =
is with
the same core crew at every major event. Consistent teamwork allows us to
rehearse maneuvers, build instinctive communication, and develop the
seamless crew work that turns good boats into winning ones (and keeps
everything safe when things get sporty).

With that in mind, what I want to determine is whether we can arrange a
consistent crew for a Summer 2026 campaign.

Here are the key events I=E2=80=99m targeting (racing dates listed; I would=
 plan a
dedicated practice/tune-up day prior for boat setup, crew drills, and team
bonding):

   - Bayview One Design Regatta =E2=80=93 Detroit, MI (Bayview Yacht Club):=
 May
   29-31, 2026 (practice day May 28) Official site: https://www.byc.com/
   (event details/updates posted here as available)
   - Chicago Sailing World Regatta =E2=80=93 Chicago, IL (Chicago Yacht Clu=
b): June
   5-7, 2026 (practice day June 4) Official series page:
   https://www.sailingworld.com/regatta-series-chicago Hosted by Chicago
   Yacht Club: https://www.chicagoyachtclub.org/
   - Cleveland Race Week One Design =E2=80=93 Edgewater Yacht Club, Clevela=
nd, OH:
   June 19-21, 2026 (practice/tune-up day June 18; this is the buoy/one-des=
ign
   racing weekend we=E2=80=99re targeting within the larger CRW event) Offi=
cial CRW
   site: https://www.clevelandraceweek.com/ Hosted by Edgewater Yacht Club:
   https://www.eycweb.com/
   - Tartan 10 North American Championship =E2=80=93 Vermilion, OH: August =
10-14,
   2026 (practice day August 9) Details via T-10 Class Association:
   https://ttenclass.com/ (NAC regulations, updates, and host info posted
   here)

These are high-caliber regattas with excellent competition=E2=80=94often 5-=
10
pro-crewed boats alongside strong Corinthian teams like ours.

*To be clear, our goal is to perform at the highest level we=E2=80=99re cap=
able of
as amateurs*, through preparation, consistency, and execution. If we do
that we can be proud of ourselves.

A few safety points:

   - Safety is our top priority. *Independence* carries all mandatory and
   recommended safety equipment (life jackets, harnesses, jacklines, VHF-AV=
I,
   EPIRB, flares, etc.).
   - Safety improves dramatically with a stable, familiar crew=E2=80=94rehe=
arsed
   roles, predictable movements, and built-in trust reduce risks, especiall=
y
   in stronger winds where the real fun (and speed) happens.
   - As mentioned, the boat and I thrive on racing in stronger breeze (15+
   MPH) and I want us positioned to push hard when conditions allow=E2=80=
=94but that
   requires flawless, seamless crew work.

To achieve this, we=E2=80=99ll need to invest time in practices and cohesio=
n. I=E2=80=99ll
bring experienced T-10 sailors, but the competitive edge comes from a
consistent team.

That beings me to the commitment question: I=E2=80=99m specifically looking=
 for
people who can commit to all or nearly all of the four major events
identified above (plus their associated practice days) as the foundation of
our campaign.

This consistency is key to building the chemistry that makes everything
click=E2=80=94safety, fun, and results.

If your schedule allows full participation, that=E2=80=99s ideal and what I=
=E2=80=99m
prioritizing. If full commitment isn=E2=80=99t possible but you=E2=80=99re =
interested in
multiple events or helping with practices, let me know=E2=80=94we can discu=
ss.

One class rule reminder: Sanctioned events such as the four I have listed
allow a maximum crew weight limit of 1,275 lbs (total for all crew). There
is a weigh-in at the North American regatta. To stay legal and optimize
setup, I=E2=80=99ll need accurate current weights from everyone.

If you=E2=80=99re able to commit to the full slate (or have questions about=
 partial
involvement), please reply soon with:
=E2=80=A2 Your availability/confirmation for the dates
=E2=80=A2 Experience and preferred roles (if any)
=E2=80=A2 Current approximate weight
=E2=80=A2 Any other thoughts

I=E2=80=99m eager to build this team and make 2026 memorable=E2=80=94let=E2=
=80=99s go racing!

Best regards,
Tom Humphrey
